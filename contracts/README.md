## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
The contracts are designed to work seamlessly with the Next.js frontend:

1. **Wallet Connection**: MetaMask integration for user authentication
2. **Event Management**: Create, join, and manage events
3. **Profile System**: Complete profile setup and management
4. **Badge Display**: Show earned and equipped badges
5. **Leaderboards**: Display game and event leaderboards
6. **QR Code System**: Generate and scan QR codes for connections

### Backend Integration
- **IPFS Storage**: Metadata and image storage
- **Event Listeners**: Real-time updates via contract events
- **Analytics**: Track user engagement and platform metrics
- **Notification System**: Alert users of achievements and connections

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.19
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Hardhat or Remix IDE
- Arbitrum Sepolia testnet

### Deployment Order
1. Deploy ZynqtraProfile

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Profile
```solidity
string[] memory interests = ["Web3", "Networking", "Blockchain"];
profileContract.createProfile(
    "John Doe",
    "john@example.com",
    interests,
    "QmHash...",
    "johndoe",
    "johndoe"
);
```

### Creating an Event
```solidity
string[] memory targetInterests = ["Web3", "Networking"];
uint256 eventId = eventsContract.createEvent(
    "Web3 Meetup",
    "Monthly Web3 networking event",
    "San Francisco, CA",
    "QmEventHash...",
    block.timestamp + 7 days,
    block.timestamp + 7 days + 3 hours,
    100,
    0.01 ether,
    ZynqtraEvents.EventType.Networking,
    targetInterests,
    100,
    false
);
```

### Awarding a Badge
```solidity
badgesContract.awardBadge(
    userAddress,
    badgeId,
    "event_completion"
);
```

## Gas Optimization

The contracts are optimized for gas efficiency:
- Batch operations for multiple users
- Efficient data structures
- Minimal storage operations
- Optimized loops and iterations

## Future Enhancements
