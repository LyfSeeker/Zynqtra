# Zynqtra

Zynqtra is a gamified networking platform designed to make real world events such as conferences, meetups, and competitions more interactive and meaningful. Participants can connect through interest based profile matching and interactive challenges, earning Z points as they climb live leaderboards. This creates a win win experience where participants enjoy fun and rewarding interactions while hosts can recognize and reward the most engaged attendees. Sponsors also benefit by creating custom challenges that increase visibility and help make events more successful.

## Go To Market (GTM) Plan

Our initial focus is to collaborate with student communities and campus networks to onboard our first wave of users. As students, we can leverage our network to reach our first 100 users quickly. After that, we plan to expand into larger events, conferences, and meetups by partnering with event organizers and sponsors. This community first growth approach helps us validate the product while creating a strong base of engaged users.

- Wallet integration with Wagmi and MetaMask  
- Smart contracts deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia for points and leaderboard logic
